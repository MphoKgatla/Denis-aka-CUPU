        Love has a way of taking us by surprise—like hearing a song that instantly transports you back to a moment, a feeling, a person who changed everything.

        <div class="song-title">🎵 "Shela" - Sam Deep</div>
        <p>
          There's something about this song that just hits different. The smooth Amapiano rhythms, the soulful vibes—it's the kind of music that makes you close your eyes and feel everything deeply. When I hear "Shela," I think of you. It captures that feeling of being completely captivated by someone, when every beat reminds you of their smile, their laugh, the way they make everything better just by being there.

        Nelly, this Valentine's Day, I want you to know how much you mean to me. Like the rhythm of "Shela," you bring harmony to my life. Every moment with you feels like the perfect beat—unexpected, beautiful, and completely unforgettable.

        <h2>💌 A message just for you</h2>

        <p><strong>CUPU, nana, moche, Dennis…</strong> listen to me for a second.</p>

        <p>I love you. I love you fully and genuinely. Not halfway, not sometimes — always.</p>

        <p>
          I know sometimes your pride makes you hold things in. You act like you don’t need anyone, like you’re okay even when you’re not. I see it, and I understand it, because you’re strong. But I don’t want that pride to be the thing that creates distance between us when all I want is to be close to you.
        </p>

        <p>
          You don’t have to carry everything alone. You don’t have to pretend with me. I’m yours. I’m here to understand you, to listen to you, and to grow with you, not against you.
        </p>

        <p>
          You matter to me more than you realize. Your voice, your feelings, your presence… all of it matters to me.
        </p>

        <p class="signature">I love you, Dennis. Always.</p>

        Love isn't just in grand gestures or perfect moments. It's in the small things: the way you laugh at my jokes, the comfort I feel when you're near, the excitement I get every time I see your name pop up on my screen. It's in the way you make ordinary days feel extraordinary, in the dreams we're building together, in the future I can't wait to share with you.
      </p>

      <p class="closing">
        So here's to us, to this beautiful journey, to every dance we'll share,<br />
        and to the music we're creating together, one day at a time.<br /><br />
        <strong>Happy Valentine's Day, Nelly</strong><br />
        Forever yours 💕
